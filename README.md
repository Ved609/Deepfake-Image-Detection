# Deepfake Detection using Deep Learning

This project leverages deep learning to detect deepfake videos by training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. Using TensorFlow and the '1000 Videos Split' dataset from Kaggle, the model aims to distinguish real videos from deepfakes with high accuracy.

## Project Overview

With the rise of deepfake technology, distinguishing real from fake media has become crucial. This project uses a CNN-based approach to identify manipulated videos, providing a foundation for detecting deepfakes effectively.

## Dataset

- **Name**: 1000 Videos Split
- **Source**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- **Description**: The dataset contains both real and manipulated videos, which are split into training, validation, and test sets.
