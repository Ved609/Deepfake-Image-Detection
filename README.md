# Deepfake-Image-Detection
Deepfake Detection using Deep Learning: This project uses a CNN model in TensorFlow to detect deepfake videos. Trained on the '1000 Videos Split' dataset, it aims for high detection accuracy, identifying authentic versus fake videos with a targeted 90% precision. Includes preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
